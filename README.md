Overview

The Interactive 3D Globe is a web-based visualization tool that allows users to explore and interact with a globe in 3D space. The globe can display different types of data such as country markers, geographic information, or real-time statistics depending on the use case. This project showcases the power of WebGL and Three.js for creating interactive web applications.

Features

•	Rotate, zoom, and pan around the 3D globe.

•	Display markers or data points on the globe.

•	Dynamically load data from APIs or datasets.

•	Smooth animations and transitions between globe interactions.

Tech Stack

•	JavaScript: Core language for the project.

•	Three.js: Used for rendering 3D graphics in the browser.

•	WebGL: Provides low-level API for 3D rendering.

•	HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the project.
